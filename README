The scripts provided by the MSYS2-Cross project are designed for building cross-toolchain for MSYS2 with MinGW compiler from MinGW-builds[2] project.

The scripts are distributed under the 'BSD 3' license[1].

In order to use the scripts provided by the MSYS2-Cross project it is needed:

1. Windows

2. Install MSYS:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/files/external-binary-packages/
  Recommended version is rev9 or higher.

3. Get the scripts into '<msys root>/home/<user>/MSYS2-Cross':
  "cd && git clone git://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-Cross.git"

4. In the MSYS file structure delete the '/MinGW' directory.

5. Delete the paths pointing to any preinstalled MinGW from the 'PATH' environment variable.

6. Go into the MSYS2-Cross root directory.
  "cd && cd MSYS2-Cross"

7. Build script has next parameters:
  The '--buildroot=<path>' option specifies to the script to use '<path>' as build directory.
    By default used <SCRIPTS_DIR>/work.
  The '--install-top=<path>' option specifies to the script to use '<path>' as top installation directory.
    By default used "C:/crosstools" directory.
  The '--version' option print the version of MSYS2-Cross script.
  For all available options please run: "./buildall --help"

8. Run:
  "./buildall x32" - for building 32-bit cross-toolchain
  "./buildall x64" - for building 64-bit cross-toolchain (not working now)
  "./buildall x32 x64" - for building both 32 and 64 bits cross-toolchains

By default toolchain installing in "C:/crosstools/cross-msys-gcc-$GCC_VERSION".
You may change install location by pass "--install-top=$DIRECTORY" to build script.

For example:
./buildall --install-top=C:/toolchain x32
building 32-bit cross-toolchain and installing it into C:/toolchain/cross-msys-gcc-$GCC_VERSION.
